# Langgraph Agents Demo
A demo of LangGraph for building multi-agent systems, created for the 2024 AI Core Summer Interns at the University of Arizona (but made available for everyone).

## About
This tutorial is designed for beginner programmers and includes all prerequisite environment variables. We recognize that not all beginner coding environments will run the same and may be difficult to debug so we have included everything needed apart from an IDE & Python installations. 

## How to Run
Follow the instructions in the ```chatbot.ipynb``` notebook. All prerequisite environment veriables will be loaded for the code to run successfully. This notebook will walk you through a simple implementation of LangGraph agents. We encourage you to explore more complex agentic architectures with LangGraph following the completion of this tutorial.

## Disclaimers for Teaching
This tutorial is derived from LangGraph's example repos and various Youtube tutorials as cited in the notebook. Plan for this tutorial to take approx. 1 hour to teach to beginners, allowing time for questions. Basic familiarity with LLM APIs, Python programming and AI agents is assumed.
